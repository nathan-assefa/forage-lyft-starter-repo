This repository is a clone of the original forage-lyft repository. The code has been restructured to incorporate design patterns such as the Factory Method, the Strategy Pattern, and the Composition method.

### Restructuring Details:

- Implemented Factory Method pattern for creating different car models and their components.
- Utilized the Strategy Pattern to define flexible service criteria for engines and batteries.
- Applied Composition to create a modular and maintainable structure for the Car class, allowing dynamic addition of new parts and easy modification of existing components.

Feel free to explore the commit history for a detailed view of the restructuring process.
